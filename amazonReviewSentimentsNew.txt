What I liked about the gen 2 versions, were that they were compact and very flexible on how you could use them. They were easy to mount in different positions and being that they used a fairly standard USB interface for the power, you could really be flexible on how and where you mounted them. The one thing that they really missed on? The well known sound quality.<br /><br />Enter the Gen 3...<br />I really like the improvement in sound. Sure it is not a high quality speaker system, but for the size it is pretty good. Especially when you consider that you can pair them and add a sub for pretty good sound. The look is improved over the gen 2, however it does lose a little bit of the customability that the gen 2 had. With the gen 2, you could purchase different wraps, stands, clock mounts, wall mounts, etc. You could really customize it.

I did not attempt to use the 3M strips provided (the 3rd gen Dot seemed too heavy for an under cabinet position) and I also did not use the provided screws.  Instead I used two smaller screws with washers that were shorter than the 3/4"" cabinet bottom so they would not protrude into the cabinet. I also pre-drilled tiny pilot holes.

My boys are both under the age of ten, so they still have low expectations and are easily entertained by this product.<br /><br />The unfortunate thing is that you have to be ultra specific when using commands - and even then, the Alexa AI struggles.

For music, yes, this is an excellent device.  The sound is loud, clear and surprisingly well-rounded.  Alexa recognizes voice commands very well in this respect.  Movies, on the other hand, are a struggle.  First, Alexa does not recognize most movie names by voice command, even ones I know are on Prime Video.  Next, if you have Alexa take you directly to Prime Video, it offers only a &#34;lite&#34; version of the service.  You cannot search movies well and the few categories they have stop at 60 results.  Being that I can easily stream 4-6 movies a day while working, I've already exhausted most of the good choices.  Then, for whatever reason, the audio volume on videos is 50-70% lower than music.
