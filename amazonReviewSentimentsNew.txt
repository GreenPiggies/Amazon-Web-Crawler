What I liked about the gen 2 versions, were that they were compact and very flexible on how you could use them. They were easy to mount in different positions and being that they used a fairly standard USB interface for the power, you could really be flexible on how and where you mounted them. The one thing that they really missed on? The well known sound quality.<br /><br />Enter the Gen 3...<br />I really like the improvement in sound. Sure it is not a high quality speaker system, but for the size it is pretty good. Especially when you consider that you can pair them and add a sub for pretty good sound. The look is improved over the gen 2, however it does lose a little bit of the customability that the gen 2 had.

Make the Dot control the light and connect to the other Dots in my house. They were lost and just couldn't get it. After they hung up on me intentionally three separate times, I simply deleted the entire system and wiped them clean then reinstalled as one complete new system without their help and it works just fine now. Certainly NOT because of tech support. Get techs that are trained or don't offer so called tech support. Because they gave me nothing but anxiety and attitude.
