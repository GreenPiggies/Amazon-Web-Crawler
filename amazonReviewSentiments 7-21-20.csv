page1-review1,"""Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2018""",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MKDD2SPE6GUP/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B07FZ8S74R,"Love the Dot and its new look, but the sound is still disappointing","I've been a happy owner of a 2nd generation Echo and three 2nd generation Echo Dots for a year now, and I was glad to add this to the arsenal.  After using it for a few days I am generally pleased with it, but it does have limitations, especially when it comes to sound quality (no surprise there!).  I will start by summarizing what's new about the 3rd Generation Dot, then I'll describe the device in more detail, and finally I'll add some thoughts about how to choose which Echo device may be best for you.<br /><br />The most obvious update to the Dot is the new look: it's as if someone took a 2nd generation Dot, inflated it with an air pump, and wrapped the edge in fabric.  And it's not bad!<br /><br />What's different/updated in the 3rd Generation Dot:<br />1) It is slightly larger than the 2nd generation device, measuring 3.9&#34; wide x 1.7&#34; tall (2nd gen was 3.3&#34; wide x 1.3&#34; tall), and the top and bottom edges are more rounded.  It is also substantially heavier at nearly twice the weight of the 2nd generation model.<br />2) The 2nd generation Dot came in two color options (black and white), each of which had a shiny plastic exterior that I personally thought looked a little cheap.  The 3rd generation Dot has a fabric exterior which gives it a classier appearance, and it's available in three colors: heather grey, sandstone, and charcoal.  The fabric and rounded edges give the 3rd generation Dot a much softer look than its predecessor.<br />4) The 3rd generation Dot has a larger speaker (1.6&#34;, versus 1.1&#34; on the 2nd gen), which is paired with a larger driver as well.  I'll talk below about the effect this has on audio quality.<br />5) The placement of the microphones is slightly different: while the 2nd generation had seven small far-field microphones on its top surface; the 3rd generation has four microphones.<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Overall appearance<br />---------------------------<br />I purchased the &#34;sandstone&#34; version. The cloth is a polyester woven fabric made up of lighter and darker shades which gives it more visual interest than if it were just a solid, uniform gray. The neutral color blends in with nearly any decor, and the cloth gives the unit a softer look which is great for areas of your house where you don't want something that screams &#34;I'm a device!&#34;<br /><br />Aside from its larger size and slight convex bulge, the top of the device is nearly identical to that of the 2nd generation Dot: it has four buttons (volume up, volume down, microphone off, and an &#34;action&#34; button) and a multi-colored light ring around the top edge that tells you about the Echo's status.  The side of the device has an input for the power cable and a 3.5-mm output jack.<br /><br />One notable improvement is the shape of the power cable, which sits flatter against the wall than the 2nd generation Dot's cable (see my photo to see them side by side).  This may sound like an insignificant change, but it makes a huge difference if you want to plug the cable into an outlet that is behind a piece of furniture.<br /><br />-------------<br />Setup<br />-------------<br />Setting up the Dot couldn't be easier.  You simply plug in the power cable, then use the Alexa app on your phone to connect the Dot to your WiFi network.  The app leads you through everything, and the whole process takes less than a minute.  Boom.<br /><br />----------------<br />Audio<br />----------------<br />I did a side-by-side audio comparison of the 2nd and 3rd Generation Echo Dots, first with music (orchestral, a jazz combo, and some AC/DC) and then with a few newscasts.  Everything does sound better on the 3rd generation Dot, but to be honest, the sound is still pretty anemic.  Compared with the 2nd generation Dot, the sound is slightly fuller, not as annoyingly tinny, and has a small amount of bass presence (not much, but the 2nd generation had none).  Newscasts and other spoken texts benefit from the fuller sound as well, but the difference is more pronounced with music.  Just for fun, I also compared the 3rd generation Dot with my 2nd generation Echo, and THAT'S where I noticed a big difference.  Yes, the new Dot sounds a bit better than its predecessor, but they both sound weak compared to the full-sized Echo.  (To its credit, Amazon doesn't claim that the Dot has room-filling sound.)<br /><br />I'll be blunt: I really like the Dot, but I don't use it to listen to music.  At all.  With so many other speaker options out there, there's just no reason to use this as your primary music device.<br /><br />-------------------------<br />Voice recognition<br />-------------------------<br />As I mentioned above, the number of microphones on the top surface has dropped from seven to four.  I'm not sure what the rationale for this was, but after testing the Dot's ability to pick up my voice from different distances and angles, I didn't notice a substantial difference in the overall microphone sensitivity compared to the 2nd generation Dot.  Like the other Echo devices, though, it seems to have more difficulty detecting voices that come from below it (which happens if I talk to it while I'm on the floor playing with my daughter).<br /><br />-------------------<br />Functionality<br />-------------------<br />The bottom line is that the overall functionality -- what the 3rd generation Dot &#34;does&#34; -- is nearly identical to that of the previous generations (and of other Echo devices, or at least the ones without screens).  This is largely because the Alexa assistant software on which all Echos operate is run on Amazon's cloud, not your individual device.  This means that as Amazon adds new features and updates to Alexa they automatically become available on all Echo devices.  So, you can use any of them to:<br /><br />- Stream music via WiFi from multiple sources<br />- Control smart home devices with your voice<br />- Make hands-free calls to other Echo devices or phone numbers in North America<br />- Make purchases from your Amazon Prime account<br />- Listen to news feeds, podcasts, etc.<br />- Do anything else in Alexa's ever-growing skill set, such as make shopping lists, set timers/alarms/reminders, play games, tell you your daily schedule, and any other skills Amazon dreams up for Alexa in the future.<br /><br />If you don't want to use the Dot's built-in speaker, you can connect it to your own speakers via Bluetooth or by using the 3.5-mm output jack.<br /><br />One new feature for the 3rd generation Dot is a little puzzling to me: You can pair two Echo Dots in a &#34;stereo mode,&#34; giving you essentially left and right speakers.  I tried this briefly and the results were pretty much what I expected: yes, it's stereo, but it's still weak sound!  You can also pair an Echo Sub with the Dots, creating a little 2.1 sound system.  Frankly, I'm not sure why you would do this; if I were setting up for stereo sound, I would want speakers that are designed for decent audio performance, not two Echo Dots.<br /><br />Alexa's skill set is enormous and always growing.  In fact, part of the fun of owning an Echo device is seeing what new skills Amazon comes up with (even if many new skills are just silly or entertaining).  I'll mention two of my favorite skills here: the Flash Briefing and the drop-in feature. The flash briefing is fully customizable daily digest of news and other information which you can hear any time by asking &#34;What's my flash briefing?&#34; There is a huge list of content you can add to your briefing including news updates, weather forecasts, sports and traffic updates, and educational snippets along with many that are just humorous or entertaining. Using the Alexa phone app or your Echo account page you can select exactly what content you want in your briefing and in what order you want to hear it. For example, I configured mine with news feeds from NPR, BBC, and Reuters. I love having an on-demand synopsis of the latest news from my favorite sources.<br /><br />My other favorite feature, &#34;drop in,&#34; essentially opens a two-way communication channel between any two Echo devices, sort of like an intercom. Simply ask Alexa to &#34;drop in on [the living room, the kitchen...]&#34; and you are instantly connected. My wife and I use this feature to communicate from opposite ends of the house. You can turn drop-in capability on or off for each of your Echo devices individually, and you can also choose whether each device can drop in with ANY Echo device or only those in your own home.<br /><br />[Note that the drop-in feature is NOT the same thing as Alexa's hands-free calling feature. Hands-free calling allows you to call most phone numbers and Echo devices in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada from your Echo by saying your contact's name or number. Just like with a phone call, the other person must choose to answer your call before you can communicate. By contrast, with the drop-in feature communication is instantly established. For this reason you will probably want to use drop-in only with your closest family and friends, and probably only for certain rooms in your home!]<br /><br />-----------------------------------<br />A few (minor) complaints<br />-----------------------------------<br />Unfortunately this 3rd Generation Dot shares an annoying trait of its predecessors: widely varying volume levels within the daily Flash Briefing. As you listen to the briefing, some components (such as BBC News) come through quietly while others (like Reuters) are much louder.  Not a deal-breaker, but slightly annoying.<br /><br />Also, occasionally when Alexa misunderstands a command, you have to &#34;start over,&#34; which can be really irritating.  For example, if Alexa thinks you asked to turn on a light but you really asked something else, she will repeatedly say &#34;In which room?&#34; until you say &#34;Alexa, stop&#34; and then start over.  I'm guessing this type of thing will improve over time as voice recognition software  becomes more advanced.  This is really more of an Alexa issue than a Dot issue, but it drives me nuts at times.<br /><br />Finally, I wish the Alexa phone app was easier to use.  It works, but its organization is not intuitive and it feels rather clunky to navigate.  Again, this is more of an &#34;Alexa&#34; issue than a &#34;Dot&#34; issue, but still... Hopefully Amazon will continue to make improvements to it!<br /><br />--------------<br />A few tips<br />--------------<br />1) The Dot seems to pick up voices best when placed at or below eye level (i.e., roughly the level from which your voice emits). Mine has trouble detecting voices coming from below it, so I don't recommend placing this on a high shelf.<br /><br />2) When you select news feeds for your Flash briefing I recommend picking one U.S. source and one international source (I use NPR and BBC - both are excellent). If you add too many feeds you'll get a lot of overlap and hear the same story several times.<br /><br />3) If you have multiple Echo devices in your home, sometimes speaking to one will cause others to respond as well, especially if they are in close proximity (like in adjacent rooms). One way to prevent this is to change the wake word of one of the devices to &#34;Echo&#34; or &#34;Amazon.&#34; The only downside is that you then have to remember which wake word you assigned to each device!<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Echo Dot vs. Echo vs. Echo Plus: Which one to buy?<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />(Please note that I am only comparing Echo devices that do NOT have screens.)<br /><br />When choosing between the Echo Dot and one of the larger Echo devices, perhaps the most important question to ask is &#34;How much do you plan to LISTEN to the device?&#34;  This question is important because one of the biggest differences between the Echo Dot and the larger Echo devices is sound quality: the 1.6&#34; speaker of the Dot simply cannot match the fullness and heft of the Echo or Echo Plus.  (Remember, they all run on the same Alexa software, which means they all have nearly identical skill sets!)<br /><br />So, if you don't currently own an Echo device, start by thinking carefully about how you plan to use it.  Many Alexa skills fall into one of two broad categories: those that rely heavily on the speaker and those that don't.  For example, features that benefit from good sound quality include playing music/newscasts/podcasts, the drop-in feature, and hands-free calling.  (This is why I chose an Echo Plus for my kitchen - I use it every morning to listen to the news.)  If you plan to use your device largely for these type of features, you would probably appreciate the better sound of the Echo or Echo Plus.<br /><br />On the other hand, if plan to use the Echo mainly for &#34;non-listening&#34; purposes such as voice-controlling your smart home devices, then the sound quality isn't as important and a Dot is probably all you need.  In fact, you could even save some money by purchasing a 2nd generation Dot instead -- especially if it's not going to be in a highly visible location or you don't mind its shiny plastic look.  I have several &#34;single-purpose&#34; Dots in my house in rooms where I want to voice-control one thing, such as a lamp in the room, and 2nd generations Dots are just fine for this -- and now that their price has gone down they are a great value!<br /><br />==========<br />Bottom line<br />==========<br />The Echo Dot is an extraordinarily useful and versatile device -- one that becomes more useful all the time as Alexa's skill set expands.  The 3rd Generation model has a great new look, but despite marginal improvements in the speaker, it's still pretty unsatisfying as a playback device for music or  newscasts.  As long as you are willing to accept its acoustic limitations, the Dot can be a wonderful device to have in your home.  And if you DO want better sound quality for the features you use most often, you can always connect the Dot to your own sound system via Bluetooth or the 3.5-mm audio jack.  Hope this was helpful!",,,,,,,,Frederick,,,,,,,B07FZ8S74R,AmazonReview,,,,

What I liked about the gen 2 versions, were that they were compact and very flexible on how you could use them. They were easy to mount in different positions and being that they used a fairly standard USB interface for the power, you could really be flexible on how and where you mounted them. The one thing that they really missed on? The well known sound quality.<br /><br />Enter the Gen 3...<br />I really like the improvement in sound. Sure it is not a high quality speaker system, but for the size it is pretty good. Especially when you consider that you can pair them and add a sub for pretty good sound. The look is improved over the gen 2, however it does lose a little bit of the customability that the gen 2 had. With the gen 2, you could purchase different wraps, stands, clock mounts, wall mounts, etc. You could really customize it. The gen 3 is a bit bigger and has a much more rounded shape. While it makes it look better by itself, it lacks the ability to really customize it. It surely would not work as a power socket mount, like you could do with the gen 2, just due to the additional weight.<br /><br />That is before you get to the horrendous power cord and adapter. The power adapter is twice as big as the gen 2 and the power cord went away from the, easy to find, usb style cord to a old style input style and it is permanently attached to the power adapter. This is really my biggest complaint as it took away so much flexibility, that you could enjoy with the gen 2. Don't get me wrong, I am sure there will be several new cords and adapters put out to fill the gap, but that is not as easy as using cords many already have. Just makes no sense. Not to mention the cord is really long, so in areas where you want it to be a bit more discreet, this thing sticks out like a sore thumb.<br /><br />What I like...<br />Sound Quality is a step up<br />Sound Volume is much improved<br />Base look is much improved<br /><br />What I dislike...<br />Much less flexibility on how it is used versus previous version<br />Non-standard power cord<br />Bulky adapter<br />Ugly long cord",,,,,,,,Clintre,,,,,,,B07FZ8S74R,AmazonReview,,,,

The audio and video signals are not clear.  The audio cuts in and out to the point where conversing with the person at your door is simply not possible.  The video gets pixelated and is difficult to view.  The camera itself is sub-standard.  Anything within 10 feet is clear but beyond that it's just a blur.  You would think with today's camera lens technology Ring could provide a more distant clear field of view. But it does not.  Anyone or anything that causes the alarm to kick in - and is more than 10 feet away from the Doorbell may as well be wearing a disguise because you will surely not be able to discern who or what it is that set off the alarm.  Then there's the latency between the time the Camera triggers an alarm and the time when you actually get to view the video.  So long that any perpetrator would have stolen your packages and be in the next town!  And then there's the unexplainable drops in connection.  Complete loss of video and audio.  Ring techs can't even figure out how to solve this problem.  And NO, it's not because my wifi speed is too slow or my wifi router is too far away.  I run at 300mbps and I'm only 50 feet from my  camera. And now I just discovered that my video recording will cease after a few days and RING wants me to pay a monthly fee for a feature that was clearly offer to me as part of my purchase.  It's a SCAM!  The product just simply does NOT perform as advertised.  I feel like I have wasted hundreds of my hard earned dollars on a security system that is more trouble than anything else.  It's actually a joke or better yet - a Ring SCAM!  Do not purchase any Ring product.  They simply do not work.<br /><br />Update: Christmas 2019 - When I needed this Ring Camera to work the most - it continues to fail.  What a waste of money!

I have used Amazon devices for around eight years now. I currently own three Kindle e-readers (Kindle Touch, Kindle Paperwhite 3rd generation, and Kindle 10). I also own four Amazon Fire tablets (2015 Fire 7 -5th generation, 2019 Fire 7 – 9th generation, 2017 Fire HD 8 - 7th generation and 2018 Fire HD 8 –8th generation) and 3 Echo devices (1st generation Echo, 2nd generation Echo Dot, and 3rd generation Echo Dot). Please note that I have traded-in some of the dated versions of the above-listed products to get upgraded versions (more on this under the “Saving Money on Purchases” section).<br /><br />This device is Amazon’s most recently refreshed (2019 – 9th generation) Fire tablet 7 inch at an outstanding price. The Fire 7 (9th generation) is definitely slightly better than the previous generation. The combination of quality and value are really tough to beat and the tablet does well overall. This is a comprehensive review, but for those looking for the bottom line, scroll down to the bottom to see some feedback on how to save money on purchasing the Fire and my final recommendations.<br /><br />Below is my summary of the “Fire 7.” I have spent the past few days playing around with the Fire, using it, and reading other online reviews about this version to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of information provided in this review. For reference purposes, this Fire model was last refreshed in 2017. This review has overlaps with my review of the Fire 7 Kids Edition tablet because both of these are essentially the same tablet but to a different audience.<br /><br />-THE BOX: The Fire 7 tablet, a quick-start guide, basic safety instructions, 5W wall adapter, and a USB cord (around 3 foot or 36 inches). The item arrived sealed and packaged well.<br /><br />- AVAILABILITY: Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, and Sage are the base colors variants. Additionally, covers can be purchased for $29.99 in the same color scheme as the Fire tablet from Amazon. Personally, I wouldn’t recommend these overpriced covers. There are several other high quality and aesthetically pleasing covers that can be found on Amazon that are affordable, well rated, and function better.<br /><br />- Key things that have not changed from the prior Fire 7 model:<br />--- Display size remains the same<br />--- PPI remains the same at 171<br />--- RAM remains the same at 1 GB of RAM.<br />--- Speaker and microphone remains the same (mono speaker with built-in microphone)<br />--- Size specifications remain the same<br />--- Warranty remains the same (90-day limited warranty)<br /><br />- Summary of key aspects (listed in order of importance) that have changed in this version (Fire 7: 2019: 9th generation) from prior generation Fire 7 tablet (2017: 7th generation). For the below comparison, the new version will be listed as Fire 2019 and the previous model as Fire 2017.<br />---  Fire 2019: Increased storage options (16 GB or 32 GB) as compared to prior version Fire 2017 (8 GB or 16 GB).<br />--- Battery life has declined to 7 hours (1-hour reduction) from prior version.<br />--- Charge time has decreased from 6 hours (Fire 2017) to 4 hours (Fire 2019). This is a major plus because it would take forever to charge these tablets). Again, please note that this claim (regarding charging time) holds true only if an Amazon wall outlet is used. The tablet usually notifies you when you are using a non-compatible wall outlet and cable. I have tested charging speeds on third-party wall ports and noticed a substantial increase in charging time as compared to using an Amazon wall outlet. So, ideally, consumers should use only the Amazon wall outlet for fast charging.<br />--- The new processor based on specs provided by Amazon to developers Fire 7 2019 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A53 (1.3 GHz)] vs. Fire 7 2017 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A7 (1.3 GHz)] is a bit faster. Again, this is my initial assessment. This would require additional testing and I will put in these numbers at a later time when they become available.<br />--- Camera quality has improved 2 MP front and rear-facing cameras with 720p HD video recording as compared to the prior version.<br />--- Slight decrease in weight (0.3 oz/9 grams)<br />--- Light sensor added (mentioned in developer information page).<br />--- Three new colors added (Twilight Blue, Plum, and Sage) in addition to Black.<br /><br />- Technical specs and other details:<br />--- Size: 7.6” x 4.5” x 0.4” (192 x 115 x 9.6 mm).<br />--- 171 pixel per inch (PPI) with IPS display technology and advanced polarizing filter. This basically means that there is a bright display with vivid colors and whiter whites for a great viewing experience from all angles.<br />--- 7-inch screen, 1024 x 600 resolution with SD video playback<br />--- Internal Storage: 16 or 32 GB<br />--- External Storage: expandable storage using MicroSD card for up to 512 GB + unlimited cloud storage for Amazon digital content purchases.<br />--- Weight: 10.1 oz/286 grams<br />--- Amazon’s digital assistant: Hands-free Alexa enabled. This option basically converts the device into a stand-alone device that can do multiple functions. For instance, if you are cooking and want help, you can ask Alexa to pull up the instructions for “Mashed Potatoes” and it will do so.<br />--- Warranty and Service: 90-day limited warranty and service included.

Since, this is for a different audience, I will not deal with it in this review.<br /><br />- Comparison between Fire 7 (this version – 2019 release) and Fire HD 8 (2018 release – mid-tier model):<br />--- Charge time: Fire HD 8 (6 hours) vs. Fire 7 (4 hours)<br />--- Display Size: Fire HD 8 (8 inches) vs. Fire 7 (7 inches)<br />--- Video playback: Fire HD 8 (HD video playback) vs. Fire 7 (SD video playback)<br />--- Resolution: Fire HD 8 (1280 * 800; 189 PPI) vs. Fire 7 (1024 *600; 171 PPI)<br />--- RAM: Fire HD 8 (1.5 GB RAM) vs. Fire 7 (1 GB RAM)<br />--- Battery life: Fire HD 8 (10 hours) vs. Fire 7 (7 hours),<br />--- Speaker: Fire HD 8 (Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers) vs. Fire 7 (Mono speaker)<br />--- Weight: Fire HD 8 (12.8 oz, 363 g) vs. Fire 7 (10.1 oz, 286 g)<br />--- Expandable Storage (internal storage remains same): Fire HD 8 (expandable by to 400 GB) vs. Fire 7 (expandable by up to 512 GB).<br />--- Colors: Fire HD 8 (Black, Marine Blue, Punch Red, Canary Yellow) vs.. Fire 7 (Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, Sage)<br />--- Cost: Fire HD 8 (16 GB - $79.99; 32 GB - $109.99) vs. Fire HD 7 (16 GB - $49.99; 32 GB - $69.99)<br />--- Multi-touch: Fire HD 8 (10-point) vs. Fire 7 (5-point)<br />--- Processors, software version, and cameras remain the same on both units.<br /><br />- Comparison between Fire 7 (this version – 2019 release) and Fire HD 10 (2017 release – mid-tier model):<br />--- Charge time: Fire HD 10 (5 hours) vs. Fire 7 (4 hours)<br />--- Display Size: Fire HD 10 (10.1 inches) vs. Fire 7 (7 inches)<br />--- Video playback: Fire HD 10 (HD video playback; 1080p HD resolution) vs. Fire 7 (SD video playback)<br />--- Resolution: Fire HD 10 (1920 * 1200; 224 PPI) vs. Fire 7 (1024 *600; 171 PPI)<br />--- Processor: Fire HD 10 [2xARM Cortex-A72 (1.8 GHz), 2xARM Cortex-A53 (1.4 GHz)] vs. Fire 7 inch (ARM Cortex-A53 Quad-Core 1.3 GHz) (basically Fire HD 10 would be substantially faster than either the Fire 7 or Fire HD 8)<br />--- RAM: Fire HD 10 (2 GB RAM) vs. Fire 7 (1 GB RAM)<br />--- Battery life: Fire HD 10 (10 hours) vs. Fire 7 (7 hours),<br />--- Speaker: Fire HD 10 (Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers) vs. Fire 7 (Mono speaker)<br />--- Camera: Fire HD 10 (0.3 MP front-facing and 2 MP rear-facing camera) vs. Fire 7 (2 MP front-facing and rear-facing camera)<br />--- Weight: Fire HD 10 (17.7 oz, 500 g) vs. Fire 7 (10.1 oz, 286 g)<br />--- Internal Storage: Fire HD 10 [32 GB (25.4 GB available to user) or 64 GB (54.1 GB available to user)] vs. Fire 7 [(internal storage remains same - 16 GB (9.4 GB available to user) or 32 GB (23.6 GB available to user)]<br />--- Expandable Storage: Fire HD 10 (expandable by to 256 GB) vs. Fire 7 (expandable by up to 512 GB).<br />--- Colors: Fire HD 10 (Black, Marine Blue, Punch Red) vs..

VoiceView features text-to-speech voice. Fire OS 5 also includes system wide closed caption settings, adjustable font sizes up to 50% larger, and a variety of book reading text adjustments such as adjustable colors and text spacing. Also includes adjustable font sizes/color, and built-in Oxford dictionary.”<br />--- Surfing the web using Amazon’s web browser - Silk<br />--- Watching movies, TV shows and listening to music.<br />--- Ability to read Kindle books.<br />--- Ability to read the news using Washington Times<br />--- Other apps (games, educational tools, etc. available in Amazon’s app store) plus several prominent apps included like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc.<br />--- Ability to get set-up email apps, calendar, etc.<br />--- Ability to play games that can be downloaded from the app store.<br /><br />- Testing:<br />Wi-Fi: I was able to connect to the Wi-Fi network without any technical difficulties. The process was pretty straightforward.<br /><br />- Saving money on purchasing the Fire:<br />--- For users who want more storage, I would strongly recommend getting the Fire 7 (16 GB) and then purchasing a microSD card as opposed to getting the costlier Fire 7 (32 GB tablet). For context, users can get a 64 GB microSD card for around $12 (users might be able to get a cheaper microSD card on Amazon prime day) on Amazon which is cheaper than paying an additional $20 for Fire 7 32 GB. Additionally, the user gets more storage by getting a microSD card.<br />--- The initial purchase with a promo discount entitles the user to a ($10 app store credit value), so you are essentially paying $ 39.99 for the 16 GB Fire 7 tablet.<br />--- The cost for the 16 GB Fire 7 will be $49.99 (with special offers) or 32 GB Fire 7 for $69.99 (with special offers). Customers can disable special offers later by paying $20 if they purchase the Fire with special offers. Personally, I would recommend going the route of getting the special offers and then disabling it. The special offers only appear when the Kindle is locked/asleep and are non-intrusive. I have 6 devices, all of which have special offers and have never had an issue. However, if the user does not like the special offers, you can purchase the Fire with special offers and then remove the special offers..<br />--- You can easily trade-in your prior Fire for Amazon credit (for $5-$15 depending on version and condition), which also entitles them to receive an additional 25% discount towards their new Fire.<br />--- As previously mentioned, I would recommend avoiding purchasing extended warranty on this item.<br />--- My recommendation would be to purchase this item during a sale event (for instance, Amazon Prime day is coming up in July). The customer can get this tablet for around $20 off during Prime day (based on prior sales analysis), and then stack the trade-in price and the 25% discount to get this item for a minimal cost (maybe you can snag it for $20 in total or lesser if everything is applied correctly). However, one thing to keep in mind is that Amazon might decide to remove the trade-in gift card and 25% discount at any point.<br /><br />-Quality comment: Some customers have critiqued the prior version (Fire 7: 2017) for lack of long-term quality. Again, please remember that this product is sold for $49.99 and goes on sale for around $ 29.99. How much more can one expect for a product this affordable? I have used my prior Fire 7 (2015) for 4 years without any issues (Honestly, I am surprised it lasted this long). Additionally, it definitely is more durable than my iPad. Additionally, with the immense technological breakthroughs occurring at lightening speed, any tablet will be obsolete in a few years. So, it might be logically better to get an affordable average end tablet than investing in a high end one (unless you need a high-end one for your specific use).<br /><br />- Conclusion:<br />To sum up my review, this is the basic Amazon Fire 7 tablet. No bells and whistles, but it does the job. Limitations include sound quality, volume quality, and potential issues with MicroSDXC Card access, and basic app store.  Updates worth noting in this version include the new color options, a slight decrease in weight, increase in storage (internal and external), slightly faster processor, slightly improved cameras, and slight decrease in battery life (though this might be a more accurate representation of the life of the battery). The bottom line is that if you are looking to get a super affordable tablet that is well-rated, small, lightweight, and can complete most of the basic and some intermediate tasks along with basic entertainment, then this Fire tablet is the way to go. So, I am giving it 5/5 stars in spite of its limitations because it is really hard (if not impossible) to find a better deal at this price point.<br /><br />- UPDATE # 1 (June 10, 2019): Fire HD 8<br />I would personally recommend the Fire HD 8 (mid-tier model) as opposed to this Fire 7 (the model reviewed) for a few more dollars. This can be purchased after following the cost-saving suggestions previously listed. My reasons are several and include: the 8 inch screen (as compared to 7 inches), higher resolution (189 PPI vs. 171 PPI), increased RAM (1.5 GB vs. 1 GB), battery life (10 hours vs. 7 hours), and the feature I appreciate the most - Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers (which can make a world of difference while watching or listening to something). I own both the 7 and the 8 inch, and there is a spectacular difference in sound quality and volume between the two. Besides, most phones now have an average screen size of around 5.5 inches (many companies are moving towards a 6 inches average). So, having a 7-inch tablet might not per se make a major difference for customers because it is similar in size to their phone (unless they want to use this device as a back-up device to prevent wear and tear on their phone). Additionally, since charging takes a substantial amount of time, I would rather have a tablet with longer battery life (Fire HD 8) than shorter (Fire 7). However, please note that the last argument cuts both ways as the new Fire 7 (4 hours) charges quicker as compared to the Fire HD 8 (6 hours).<br /><br />- UPDATE # 2 (June 15, 2019): Amazon FreeTime Unlimited<br />- Amazon FreeTime Unlimited ($2.99/month after free subscription period)<br />--- Amazon FreeTime Unlimited is a subscription that offers over “20,000 books, movies, TV shows, apps and games for kids 3-12. Age Filters ensure kids see age-appropriate content. Parents can add content to kids' profiles to give them more access to apps and games.” “In FreeTime, kids do not have access to social media or Alexa. In-app purchases require parent approval. Parents can exit FreeTime using a passcode.” Another unique feature is Amazon’s FreeTime Unlimited in Spanish!<br />--- Parents also have the option “to set educational goals and curfews (using FreeTime Unlimited), and manage content for up to 4 child profiles (option given during initial set-up of the tablet) with easy-to-use parental controls.”<br />--- Generally speaking - FreeTime Unlimited offers unbeatable value – I mean where else on earth can you get kid-friendly and generally holistic content for $2.99/month (after trial subscription ends).<br />*FreeTime unlimited has several nifty features that I cannot cover because of space limitations. Parents have a lot of flexibility in choosing and curating content for children, permitting downloads, and even setting the tablet to turn-off after a preset amount of use or at a set time and turn on at a set time.<br /><br />UPDATE # 3 (June 21, 2019):  Battery Life and Software<br />Some customers have complained about the low and unpredictable battery life for this new device. I have experienced occasional battery fluctuations (my prior Fire seemed to have better battery life). So, I am docking a star. Some other reviewers have also experienced overheating of this device. Other than the occasional overheating that occur in all devices (when complex programs/apps are used for an extended period of time), I haven’t experienced anything major until now. Additionally, some customers have also complained about the new Fire OS causing problems. I have experienced occasional staggering of the OS and app closures but nothing major as described by other reviewers. I will continue my testing to see if other issues surface but just wanted to give a heads-up to customers so they are prepared in case they experience any issues in the future and want to contact Amazon about it.<br /><br />Please also note several resources were used in the compilation of this review but most of this review was based on my personal testing of the product.<br /><br />Whenever I make any purchase, I try to do a thorough and accurate job with the review. My reviews are my honest and comprehensive assessment of the product. I always post future updates and corrections based on new information if deemed necessary. Additionally, I always include photos of products to verify both that I purchased this product and to back up appropriate claims in the review. If you have any feedback or questions or corrections, leave a note in the comments section. Thank you!",,,,,,,,Professor Nishanth,,,,,,,B07Z4GHB12,AmazonReview,,,,

I have other sized Fire tablets (8 Inch) and a new ipad, plus the new Kindle paper white, but the Fire 7 is my go to tablet. What I use it for. Prime Video, Hulu, Netflix, Youtube.  Kindle reader for books and bible. Audible books from audible. Podcasts (stitcher). Comixology for comics (old school Marvel fan!). Instagram (I do not use facebook). Home automation with Alexa (control of my lights, ring alarm, alarms, and basic questions) works great both hands free as well as pressing the home button.  I also play light games on it, Word search, Temple run, Angry Birds series of games, Yahtzee, Subway Surfer, Crossy Roads, and a few others.  I also listen to Amazon prime music (Apple music does not work on this device).  I mainly use my Apple air buds when watching and listening and it sounds fantastic.  Picture quality is great.  This is a snappy little tablet and my favorite size.  It feels good in the hand with the solid plastic build (compared to the Fire 8 inch, which feels more ""cheap""). It is a great tablet to use while lying in bed, which is mainly when I use it (ipad 9.7 is to heavy). I feel that Amazon finally got it right with this new 2019 version. The previous versions are painfully slow to load anything, and that is why I never would recommend them especially for a child.  These new tablets are so much better, my wife wants one, and I will be buying them for my kids, something I would not even consider before, because of the frustration of the slowness (and the reason my kids took over the ipad and iphones in the first place).  As you can see this is a consumption device, meant for fun..not a computer or workhorse.  I should mention you can check email and use the tablet for video chatting and dropping in on other echo devices which works really well and my kids have fun using it, I should also mention that I am a Prime member and take advantage of the Prime photo storage, which any picture that I take on my iphone, pops up on my Fire Tablet. I should also mention why I use this for reading more than my paper white, it is because I like the ""page curl effect"" and the way it highlights my passages on books (I still use my paper white..but this is just a preference). The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the 2mp camera (which I do not use much) and the battery life, which is actually not bad, but Amazon asked for a ""star"" rating on those two features as well as tablet as a whole.  At $50 you can not go wrong. Plus if you have a previous version, just trade it in. I got $10 knocked off and an additional 20% savings. I think I paid about $33.  I will be trading in my 8 inch Fire for this size as well.  Great little tablet!",,,,,,,,Rick,,,,,,,B07Z4GHB12,AmazonReview,,,,
