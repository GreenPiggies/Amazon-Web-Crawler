After using it for a few days I am generally pleased with it, but it does have limitations, especially when it comes to sound quality (no surprise there!).  I will start by summarizing what's new about the 3rd Generation Dot, then I'll describe the device in more detail, and finally I'll add some thoughts about how to choose which Echo device may be best for you.<br /><br />The most obvious update to the Dot is the new look: it's as if someone took a 2nd generation Dot, inflated it with an air pump, and wrapped the edge in fabric.  And it's not bad!<br /><br />What's different/updated in the 3rd Generation Dot:<br />1) It is slightly larger than the 2nd generation device, measuring 3.9&#34; wide x 1.7&#34; tall (2nd gen was 3.3&#34; wide x 1.3&#34; tall), and the top and bottom edges are more rounded.  It is also substantially heavier at nearly","","","","","","","","Frederick","","","","","","","B07FZ8S74R","AmazonReview","","","",""

What I liked about the gen 2 versions, were that they were compact and very flexible on how you could use them. They were easy to mount in different positions and being that they used a fairly standard USB interface for the power, you could really be flexible on how and where you mounted them. The one thing that they really missed on? The well known sound quality.<br /><br />Enter the Gen 3...<br />I really like the improvement in sound. Sure it is not a high quality speaker system, but for the size it is pretty good. Especially when you consider that you can pair them and add a sub for pretty good sound. The look is improved over the gen 2, however it does lose a little bit of the customability that the gen 2 had. With the gen 2, you could purchase different wraps, stands, clock mounts, wall mounts, etc. You could really customize it. The gen 3 is a bit bigger ","","","","","","","","Clintre","","","","","","","B07FZ8S74R","AmazonReview","","","",""

The battery powered is the way to go bc u can mount anywhere u can think of, it has nice features u can literally adjust any setting u want. Battery last awhile it come with one, but the camera can fit two to have longer life, the batteries are rechargeable or u can just do the solar panel which works great.

The audio and video signals are not clear.  The audio cuts in and out to the point where conversing with the person at your door is simply not possible.  The video gets pixelated and is difficult to view.  The camera itself is sub-standard.  Anything within 10 feet is clear but beyond that it's just a blur.  You would think with today's camera lens technology Ring could provide a more distant clear field of view. But it does not.  Anyone or anything that causes the alarm to kick in - and is more than 10 feet away from the Doorbell may as well be wearing a disguise because you will surely not be able to discern who or what it is that set off the alarm.

Kindle reader for books and bible. Audible books from audible. Podcasts (stitcher). Comixology for comics (old school Marvel fan!). Instagram (I do not use facebook). Home automation with Alexa (control of my lights, ring alarm, alarms, and basic questions) works great both hands free as well as pressing the home button.  I also play light games on it, Word search, Temple run, Angry Birds series of games, Yahtzee, Subway Surfer, Crossy Roads, and a few others.  I also listen to Amazon prime music (Apple music does not work on this device).  I mainly use my Apple air buds when watching and listening and it sounds fantastic.  Picture quality is great.
